👋 Hi! I’m Lindsey. I am a fullstack web developer. I love learning new things and solving interesting problems. 

I am seeking full time employment as a fullstack, frontend, or backend web developer. I may also be open to similar software development positions. Please email me with any job inquiries. 

The tech stack I am currently learning includes: 
- Typescript
- React (Redux, Styled-Components, Storybook)
- Node.js (Express, REST) 
- MongoDB (Mongoose) 

I've also worked with Sequelize / Postgres, GraphQL, Gatsby, and C# in the past. Of course, if your tech stack is not on this list, I can just pick it up. No worries.

CONTACT ME: lindseycadwell.dev@gmail.com


When I'm not programming I enjoy...
- going to the gym or for a long walk
- dogs
- reading a good book (probably fantasy)
- learning a new language (Spanish or Chinese, depending on which way the wind is blowin')
- studying psychology or Stoic philosophy
